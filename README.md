### **Project Overview: Wazuh SIEM Setup, Vulnerability Detection, and Mitigation**

#### **Project Description:**

In this project, I set up and configured **Wazuh**, an open-source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, to enhance network security and monitor for vulnerabilities in an organization's environment. I focused on configuring the Wazuh agent to collect security data from systems and analyzing the logs to detect vulnerabilities, with a specific emphasis on **CVE-2017-11882**, a critical Microsoft Office vulnerability.

The project involved the following phases:

1. **Setting up the Wazuh Manager and Agent**.
2. **Configuring the Wazuh Agent for Vulnerability Detection**.
3. **Analyzing and Mitigating Vulnerabilities**.
4. **Creating a Continuous Monitoring and Reporting System**.

#### **Phase 1: Wazuh Manager and Agent Setup**

The first step was to install and configure the **Wazuh Manager**, which acts as the central server for collecting and analyzing logs from various sources, including endpoint devices. I set up **Wazuh agents** on my macOS device to forward logs to the manager. The agents collect system and application logs, which are then analyzed for security events.

1. **Wazuh Manager Installation**:
   - The **Wazuh Manager** was installed on a Linux server, which serves as the central point for data aggregation, rule processing, and alert generation. 
   - I configured the manager to communicate with the Wazuh agents and established a secure connection using SSL/TLS.
   - Screenshots from the Wazuh Manager UI, showing the agent connections and the manager dashboard, can be seen below.

![IMG_2223](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07d68812-939d-4dd2-8db2-11b3bbae68c2)

   
2. **Wazuh Agent Installation**:
   - The **Wazuh Agent** was installed on my macOS machine to collect logs, including system logs, application logs, and security logs. The agents were configured to send logs to the Wazuh Manager for analysis.
   - I ensured the agents were set up to collect logs that would help identify potential vulnerabilities and security events, such as file integrity monitoring, firewall logs, and software vulnerabilities.

![IMG_2226](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5877b4c-b6e3-4fdc-9ed3-5e4fe7df2e28)

 
#### **Phase 2: Configuring Wazuh for Vulnerability Detection**

Once the manager and agents were set up, I configured Wazuh to perform regular vulnerability scans and monitor for specific CVEs. Wazuh uses various rule sets to detect security events, including vulnerability-related detections. The vulnerability detection feature integrates with databases like **OpenSCAP** and **CVE** feeds to identify known vulnerabilities.

1. **Vulnerability Detection Configuration**:
   - I configured the **Vulnerability Detector** module in Wazuh, which integrates CVE databases and security advisories to automatically scan for vulnerabilities across the network.
   - Wazuh started to scan systems for known vulnerabilities like **CVE-2017-11882**, which is a Microsoft Office vulnerability allowing remote information disclosure.
   - Screenshots from the Wazuh vulnerability detection report highlighting CVE-2017-11882 can be seen below.

![IMG_2225](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da095e6d-9bea-4095-a041-e43adf96dce8)
 

2. **Customizing Rules**:
   - I customized existing rules in the Wazuh configuration to better suit the environment, ensuring that Wazuh would alert on high-severity vulnerabilities like **CVE-2017-11882** and log these events for further analysis.
   - I reviewed the specific rule set for CVE detection, ensuring that Wazuh was set to automatically generate alerts for vulnerabilities found in systems, particularly within Microsoft Office.
  
![IMG_2227](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd2c42db-bcfc-4c3f-92c4-90bc0117a5df)


#### **Phase 3: Analysis and Mitigation of Vulnerabilities**

After Wazuh began monitoring the environment, I used its capabilities to analyze detected vulnerabilities and plan mitigation strategies. I specifically focused on **CVE-2017-11882**, a vulnerability in Microsoft Word and Excel that allows attackers to exploit embedded field codes to extract sensitive information from the system.

1. **Identifying the Vulnerability**:
   - Using Wazuh's centralized logging and alerting system, I identified that **CVE-2017-11882** was present in the network.
   - The vulnerability could be exploited through malicious documents that use `INCLUDETEXT` and `INCLUDEPICTURE` field codes, allowing attackers to remotely exfiltrate sensitive data.


2. **Mitigation Plan**:
   - I applied the latest Microsoft Office security patches on all affected machines to ensure that the vulnerability was addressed at the software level.
   - To further reduce the risk, I disabled **external content updates** in Word and Excel. This step prevented the automatic pulling of data from external sources when opening potentially malicious documents.
   - I also implemented **endpoint protection** software like **Malwarebytes** to detect and block malicious documents, and I ensured that built-in macOS security features like **Gatekeeper** were configured to block untrusted files from running.

#### **Phase 4: Continuous Monitoring and Reporting**

With the vulnerability mitigated, I set up **continuous monitoring** in Wazuh to track any attempts to exploit the vulnerability in the future. This phase involved creating custom reports and alerts to ensure ongoing security vigilance.

1. **Creating Custom Reports**:
   - I configured Wazuh to generate regular reports summarizing detected vulnerabilities, the status of mitigation efforts, and any ongoing risks. These reports were designed to be easily understandable for stakeholders and IT personnel.
   
   *(![IMG_2224](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26dbeda0-c051-40d7-9812-b2accd7be574)


2. **Setting Up Real-Time Alerts**:
   - I set up **real-time alerts** to notify the security team if any future exploit attempts were detected or if any systems became vulnerable again due to missed patches or configuration issues.

#### **Project Outcome:**

The project was successful in setting up a robust **Wazuh SIEM system** that provided real-time monitoring and vulnerability detection across the network. Specifically for **CVE-2017-11882**, I was able to:
- Detect the vulnerability early using **Wazuh**'s vulnerability detection module.
- Implement effective mitigation strategies, including patching systems, disabling risky features in Microsoft Office, and educating users.
- Establish continuous monitoring and reporting mechanisms to ensure that the system remains secure against future threats.

By integrating **Wazuh** for vulnerability detection and leveraging its comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities, I was able to enhance the overall security posture of the organization.

#### **Conclusion:**

This project reinforced the importance of using a SIEM system like Wazuh for proactive vulnerability management. By configuring Wazuh to monitor for known vulnerabilities, detect exploits, and mitigate risks through patches and system configuration changes, I was able to ensure the environment remained secure and resilient to future threats.
